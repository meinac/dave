        The name "Dave" for this open-source diving application is chosen as a tribute to Dave Shaw, a legendary technical diver whose courage, compassion, and dedication to the diving community continue to inspire. Dave Shaw tragically lost his life in 2005 during a heroic attempt to recover the body of a fellow diver, Deon Dreyer, from one of the world's deepest freshwater caves, Boesmansgat in South Africa. His selfless act was a profound demonstration of the bond and respect that divers share, even in the face of extraordinary risks. By naming this application "Dave," we honor his memory and the values of bravery, camaraderie, and passion that define the diving community.
